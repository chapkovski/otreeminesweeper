   Task 2
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>The objective for Task 2 is identical to Task 1. You will be incentivized for this task and can
    receive up to $0.90  in additional compensation depending on your performance. <br> <br>
In Task 2, instead of marking bombs on each grid, you will be shown a series of gameplay scenarios.
Each gameplay scenario will include information such as the total bombs on a grid,
total bombs marked by an individual, penalty for each bomb unmarked, clicks used,
and budget set by the supervisor. For each question, you will be presented 2 gameplay scenarios
and will be asked to select the scenario that best achieves the main objective from Task 1.
    You will earn $0.10 each time you select the correct scenario, and you will make a total of 9 selections. <br> <br>
Note, please assume for each selection you have sufficient left clicks to implement one of the
    two scenarios but not both scenarios. </p><br> <br>
