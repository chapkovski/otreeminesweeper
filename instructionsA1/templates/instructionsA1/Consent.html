<p>  <font size="3">  <b>Procedure and Extra Credit:</b> You are being asked to voluntarily participate in a research study.
    This study is an experiment examining how individuals make decisions in an economic setting. Specifically,
    you will play a series of simple games. Our purpose is to build a structural econometric model that can predict
    the main features of decision making in games like these. If you choose to participate, you will receive detailed
    instructions describing the games and the rules of the experiment. The experiment could last up to 60 minutes. <br> <br>
    Throughout the experiment, you will see information about compensation for your performance. For this version of the experiment,
    you will be receiving extra credit instead of compensation. Full extra credit is conditional upon completing the
    experiment and making a good faith attempt. The experimenter may notify your instructor if they discover that you did
    not make a good faith attempt by skipping through the screens and not following instructions.
    On the last page of the experiment you will need to type in your full name to receive full credit. There will also be
    attention check questions to make sure you pay attention and comprehension questions to make sure you
    understand the instructions. You may need a calculator for some of these questions. You will not be able to continue with the experiment until
    you answer those questions correctly. </font> </p>

<br>

<p> <b>Confidentiality:</b>  The confidentiality of your data will be protected to the extent allowed by law.
    Information about your name and participation in this experiment will be retained as part of the payment records.
    Once the payment records have been processed, any identifying information will be removed from your experimental data.
    Your name will not be reported with any results related to this research. If data from this study is shared with
    other researchers in the future, no identifying information about you will be included. You will not be signing this form.  </p>
<br>
<p> Only the researcher, any research assistants conducting this experiment, and FSU administrators responsible for
    processing payoff records will know what your earnings are. Compensation you receive as a result of your participation
    in this experiment may be reported for taxation purposes to appropriate federal and state agencies, but the results
    of the study will remain confidential and will not be forwarded to tax authorities. <br> <br>
    We will store your information in ways we think are secure. We will store electronic files in
    computer systems with password protection. However, we cannot guarantee complete confidentiality. <br> <br>
