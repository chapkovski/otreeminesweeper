<p></p><br> <u>Payoffs</u><br>
You will receive cash in U.S. dollars based on your decisions for this experiment.
Earnings are based on how well you <i>marked</i> the <i>bombs</i> of greatest concern to the firm.
<br></p>
<p>You will receive an endowment of $20 at the beginning of the experiment.
If you are unable to <i>mark</i> a <i>bomb</i> on a <i>grid</i>, you will pay a penalty of one of these values
($0.05, 0.08, 0.11, depending on the grid). Remember you do not receive a penalty for 20 percent of the <i>bombs.</i>
For example, if there were 50 <i>bombs</i> total on a <i>grid</i>, you would not receive a penalty until after failing to
    <i>mark or accidentally left-clicking the 11th <i>bomb</i> (10= 20 % * 50 <i>bombs</i>).</i></p>
<br><p>
You will also pay $0.01 for a left click to reveal a square.
There is no cost for <i>marking</i> squares with <i>bombs</i>, but you may not <i>mark</i> more squares than there are total <i>bombs</i> on the <i>grid.</i>
</p><br>
<p>Here is an example of your payoffs: If you failed to <i>mark</i> 20 <i>bombs</i> on a <i>grid</i> that had 50 <i>bombs</i> total and a
$0.08 penalty was assigned to those <i>bombs</i>, your compensation at that point in the task would be: <br>
 $20-  ($0.08 * (20- 10) )-  (100*.01) = $18.20, if you used 100 reveal clicks. <br> <br>
Participant earnings= $20 -  ((Financial Penalty  ($0.05, 0.08, 0.11) X
(# of <i>Bombs</i> not <i>Marked</i> - 20 percent of the total <i>bombs</i> on that <i>grid</i> ) ) - ($0.01 X # of Clicks to Reveal Squares).<br>
</p><br> <br>
<p><u>Note-Taking and Planning</u>
<br>
For this task, the max penalty you can receive for all the <i>grids</i> is $16.58.
This means you are guaranteed $3.42 ($20 endowment- Max Penalty for missing all the <i>bombs</i>) for
attempting the task and can make around $17 based on your performance. To help you perform better, there will be a
    space provided on each <i>grid</i> to take notes and an exercise that has you reflect on those notes.
    <b>These notes are for your own benefit and will not be reviewed by anyone.</b>   </p> <br>

<p> <u>Note-Taking</u> <br>
    Remember, <i>grids</i> may differ in size, number of <i>bombs</i>, <i>and bomb</i> locations.
    These obstacles may cause you to use more clicks than you expected or accidentally open <i>bombs.</i>
    There will be a space provided on every <i>grid</i> where you should take notes on the obstacles to and your
    approach for achieving the main objective. <b>Feel free to write whatever thoughts you may have while working on
    the grids and do not worry about editing your notes. These notes will be important because you will be asked to
        refer to them and adjust your approach in a future planning session.</b>

</p> <br>

<p><u> Planning Session</u><br>
    Halfway through the first task or after period 1, you will be prompted to refer to your notes to
    understand why you may have deviated from the recommended budget. After reviewing your notes,
    you will then explain whether those deviations were reasonable given the main objective.
    Finally, you will be asked to write down at least one way you can adjust your gameplay for the next set of
    <i>grids</i> to better achieve the objective. These responses should be brief (1-2 sentences).
