<u>Compensation</u><br>
<p>Since your supervisor is interested in whether you achieve the stated objective,
    your compensation for this experiment will be based on completing that objective.
    You will begin the experiment by receiving a cash endowment from your supervisor to work on the task.  </p>
<br>
<p>Each time you click a square with a left-mouse button to open it,
    your endowment will be reduced by a small amount ($0.01). Each <i>bomb</i> has a specific financial penalty assigned to it.
    Your endowment will also decrease by this financial penalty each time you fail to <i>mark</i> a <i>bomb</i> or accidentally
            left click a <i>bomb.</i> Remember some <i>bombs</i> are assigned higher penalties based on the <i>grid.</i>
                There will be a limit to the number of penalties you can receive per <i>grid</i> such that you will not be
                    penalized for not <i>marking</i> up to 20 percent of the <i>bombs</i> on each <i>grid</i> (or you will not receive a
                    penalty for unmarked <i>bombs</i> on that <i>grid</i> if you correctly <i>mark</i> 80 percent of the <i>bombs</i>).
    Remember, this 20 percent does not include penalties for accidentally opening a <i>bomb</i> which means you will receive a penalty every time you accidentally open one.
    At the end of the task, you will be paid based on whatever remains from your cash endowment</p>
<br>
 Final Pay= Cash Endowment -Less clicks used to find bombs- Less financial penalties for accidentally left-clicking bombs-
Less penalties for not marking up to 80 percent of the bombs.
<br> <br>
<p><u>Budget</u><br>
This task will last for 2 periods, and you will have the opportunity to <i>mark bombs</i> on 12 grids (6 per period).
    To help you decide how to use clicks efficiently, you will be asked to develop a budget for each period.
    The budget will consist of selecting the order in which you plan to work on the <i>grids</i> and determining
    the number of clicks you will allocate in total for all 6 <i>grids.</i> Once you have developed your own budget,
    your supervisor will provide you their recommended budget. Their budget will arrange the <i>grids</i>
    by overall financial penalties (i.e., it will recommend that you play the high penalty <i>grids</i> first).
    It will then recommend how many clicks you should allocate in total to the 6 <i>grids</i> for each period based on the
    average number of left clicks it took past participants to achieve the main objective on <i>grids</i> of similar size and
    total number of <i>bombs.</i> Since the recommendations are based on past averages, feel free to deviate from the
    recommended budget because not all settings will be the same (i.e., although the averages are based on <i>grids</i> of
    similar size and <i>bomb</i> numbers, the location of the <i>bombs</i> will differ). Compensation is still based on the overall
    objective of prioritizing <i>grids</i> of greater concern and efficiently <i>marking</i> a sufficient number of <i>bombs</i> within them.   </p>
<br>
<p><u>Performance Measure</u> <br>
     <b>Your supervisor will measure the degree to which you stay under the recommended budgeted number of
         clicks for each grid (i.e., your click efficiency).</b>
    At the end of each period, you will receive feedback on this efficiency measure.
    Although minimizing your clicks is part of the objective, your compensation is still based on the
    overall objective of prioritizing grids of greater concern and marking a sufficient number of bombs within them.


</p> <br>
***One key distinction between this experiment and the traditional version of
Minesweeper is that incorrectly left-clicking a bomb in this game results in a
financial penalty whereas an incorrect left-click ends the game in the traditional version of Minesweeper.
